# Holberton School - Higher Level Programming

## Description

This project encompasses several sub-projects as part of the higher-level programming curriculum at Holberton School. These sub-projects cover essential concepts in Python programming and modern software development practices. You will work on everything from conditionals and loops to creating and manipulating classes and objects, as well as handling serialization and input/output.

## Sub-projects

### 1. Python - Hello World 👋🐍

An introduction to Python, where you will learn how to display messages to the console and understand the basic syntax of the language.

### 2. If, Else, Conditions ⚖️

This sub-project will help you understand and master conditional control structures in Python, such as `if`, `else`, and `elif`.

### 3. Loop 🔄

Loops are essential for iteration and repeating code blocks. You will explore `for` and `while` loops to improve your understanding of code flow.

### 4. Import & Modules 📦

Learn how to organize your code into modules and use import functions to reuse code and enhance the readability of your programs.

### 5. Test Driven Development 🧪

This sub-project introduces the concept of writing tests before the code itself, helping you ensure that your code is functioning as expected.

### 6. Data Structures 📊

Explore essential data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples, and understand how to manipulate and store data effectively in Python.

### 7. Classes and Objects 🏛️

Dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts by creating classes and objects in Python. Learn how to design and implement your own classes.

### 8. Inheritance 🧬

This sub-project introduces inheritance, a key concept in OOP that allows you to extend and modify the behavior of existing classes.

### 9. Abstract Classes and Interfaces 🎭

Learn how to use abstract classes and interfaces to define common structures and enforce consistency in your code architecture.

### 10. Input & Output 🖥️💾

Learn how to handle input from users and output data to the console or files, which is crucial for building interactive programs.

### 11. Serialization 🔐

Understand how to convert complex data structures into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted, and learn to work with formats like JSON and pickle.
