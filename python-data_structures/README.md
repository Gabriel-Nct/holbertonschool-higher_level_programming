# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Description

This project is designed to build foundational skills in Python, specifically focusing on data structures like **lists** and **tuples**. Through a series of exercises, the goal is to understand the basic concepts of these data structures, their methods, and how they are used in programming.

The project covers simple tasks such as displaying elements in a list, manipulating specific elements in lists and tuples, and more complex tasks like handling matrices and finding the maximum value in a list.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain and demonstrate the following concepts:

-   What a list is and how to use it in Python.
-   The differences and similarities between strings and lists.
-   Common list methods and how to use them.
-   How to use lists as stacks and queues.
-   The syntax of **list comprehensions** and their use cases.
-   What a tuple is, how to use it, and when to choose a tuple over a list.
-   What a sequence is in Python.
-   The concepts of **tuple packing** and **sequence unpacking**.
-   How to use the `del` statement to remove elements.

## Resources

### Read or watch:

-   [3.1.3. Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)
-   [Data structures (up to 5.3. Tuples and Sequences)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

## Requirements

-   All files should be written in Python 3.
-   Use **PEP 8** style guidelines for all Python code.
-   Code should be well-documented with clear comments where necessary.

## Project Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each requiring you to work with lists and tuples. Tasks will involve implementing functions to:

-   Access list elements by index.
-   Modify list elements.
-   Sort lists.
-   Perform tuple packing and unpacking.
-   Work with matrices.
-   Manipulate nested lists and tuples.

## Directory Structure

-   **TASKS.py**: Contains Python scripts with exercises related to lists and tuples.
-   **README.md**: This file, describing the project and requirements.

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-lists-tuples.git
```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd data-structures-lists-tuples
```

3. Open and edit the Python files to complete each task. Use your favorite code editor.

4. Run your Python scripts to test them:
```bash
python3 <script_name>.py
```
