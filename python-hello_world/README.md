# Python - Hello, World

## Description

Welcome to the Python world! This project aims to introduce you to basic Python programming concepts such as printing text, working with strings, and formatting output. You'll also become familiar with Python's official style guide, PyCode, and how to check your code using `pycodestyle`.

In Python, there are often multiple ways to accomplish the same task, and you'll have the opportunity to explore these different methods.

## Author's Disclaimer

You will soon discover that Python (and most high-level programming languages) offer many ways to do the same thing. Some tasks require a single specific approach, while others can be solved in multiple ways.

We will not initially use PyCode (which is more stringent than PEP8), so you might see warnings when running `pycodestyle`. Don't worry if you encounter such warnings – feel free to ignore them.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

-   Use the Python interpreter
-   Print text and variables using `print`
-   Work with strings
-   Understand indexing and slicing in Python
-   Follow Python's official coding style and check your code using `pycodestyle`

----------

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

-   **Allowed editors**: vi, vim, emacs
-   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.*
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
-   A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
-   Your code should follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
-   All your files must be executable
-   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks

### Task 0: Hello, print (mandatory)

Write a Python script that prints exactly:
```python
"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle
```
Followed by a new line. You should use the print function.

### Task 1: Print integer (mandatory)

Complete the source code in order to print the integer stored in the `number` variable, followed by `"Battery street"`, and a new line. You are not allowed to cast the variable `number` into a string. Use f-strings for formatting. Your code should be 3 lines long.

### Task 2: Print float (mandatory)

Complete the source code to print the float stored in the `number` variable, with a precision of 2 digits. Use f-strings for formatting. You are not allowed to cast `number` into a string.

### Task 3: Print string (mandatory)

Complete the source code to print the string stored in the variable `str` three times, followed by its first 9 characters. You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements. The program should be a maximum of 5 lines long.

### Task 4: Play with strings (mandatory)

Complete the source code to print `"Welcome to Holberton School!"` using the variables `str1` and `str2`. You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements. The program should be exactly 5 lines long.

### Task 5: Copy - Cut - Paste (mandatory)

Complete the source code. You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements. The program should be exactly 8 lines long:

-   `word_first_3` should contain the first 3 letters of the variable `word`
-   `word_last_2` should contain the last 2 letters of the variable `word`
-   `middle_word` should contain the value of the variable `word` without the first and last letters

### Task 6: Create a new sentence (mandatory)

Complete the source code to print `"object-oriented programming with Python"`, followed by a new line. You are not allowed to create new variables, and you cannot use string literals.

### Task 7: Easter Egg (mandatory)

Write a Python script that prints `"The Zen of Python"`, by Tim Peters, followed by a new line. Your script should be a maximum of 98 characters long.
