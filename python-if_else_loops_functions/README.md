## Python - If/Else, Loops, Functions

## Description

This project introduces basic Python programming concepts such as **if/else statements**, **loops**, and **functions**. You'll complete several small tasks involving control flow, loops, and basic functions in Python.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts:

-   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
-   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3` (version 3.8.*)
-   All your files must end with a new line
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
-   A **README.md** file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-   Your code should follow the **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.*)
-   All your files must be executable
-   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks

### 0. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing**

Write a program that assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

-   **Filename**: `0-positive_or_negative.py`
Example output:
```bash
-4 is negative
```

### 1. **The last digit**

Write a program that prints the last digit of a number.

-   **Filename**: `1-last_digit.py`

Example output:
```bash
Last digit of 4205 is 5 and is less than 6 and not 0
```

### 2. **I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**

Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, without a newline.

-   **Filename**: `2-print_alphabet.py`

Example output:
```bash
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

### 3. **When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**

Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, excluding `e` and `q`, in lowercase, without a newline.

-   **Filename**: `3-print_alphabt.py`

Example output:
```bash
abcdfghijklmnoprstuvwxyz
```

### 4. **Hexadecimal printing**

Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.

-   **Filename**: `4-print_hexa.py`

Example output:
```bash
0 = 0x0
1 = 0x1
...
98 = 0x62
```
### 5. **00...99**

Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99, separated by `,` .

-   **Filename**: `5-print_comb2.py`

Example output:
```bash
00, 01, 02, ..., 99
```

### 6. **Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**

Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

-   **Filename**: `6-print_comb3.py`

Example output:
```bash
01, 02, 03, ..., 89
```

### 7. **islower**

Write a function that checks whether a character is lowercase.

-   **Prototype**: `def islower(c):`
-   **Filename**: `7-islower.py`

----------

### 8. **To uppercase**

Write a function that prints a string in uppercase.

-   **Prototype**: `def uppercase(str):`
-   **Filename**: `8-uppercase.py`

----------

### 9. **There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important**

Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

-   **Prototype**: `def print_last_digit(number):`
-   **Filename**: `9-print_last_digit.py`

----------

### 10. **a + b**

Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

-   **Prototype**: `def add(a, b):`
-   **Filename**: `10-add.py`

----------

### 11. **a ^ b**

Write a function that computes `a` raised to the power of `b`.

-   **Prototype**: `def pow(a, b):`
-   **Filename**: `11-pow.py`

----------

### 12. **FizzBuzz**

Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with `Fizz`, multiples of 5 with `Buzz`, and multiples of both with `FizzBuzz`.

-   **Prototype**: `def fizzbuzz():`
-   **Filename**: `12-fizzbuzz.py`

Example output:
```bash
1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz ...
```
