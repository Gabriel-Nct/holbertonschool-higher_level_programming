## 📌 Description  
This project dives deeper into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python**. We explore **classes, instances, attributes, methods, and special methods**, strengthening our understanding of how objects work in Python.  

## 📚 Resources  
Make sure to read or watch the following materials before starting:  

- [Object-Oriented Programming](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) 🏛  
- [Class and Instance Attributes](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_class_and_instance_attributes.php) 📖  
- [classmethods and staticmethods](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_classmethods_and_staticmethods.php) 🏷  
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://realpython.com/python-property/) 🔑  
- [Difference between `str` and `repr`](https://realpython.com/python-repr-vs-str/) 🧐  

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  
By the end of this project, you should be able to:  

✅ Understand **why Python programming is awesome** 💡  
✅ Explain **what Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is** 🏗  
✅ Differentiate **class, object, and instance** 🆚  
✅ Use **public, protected, and private attributes** 🔒  
✅ Define and use **methods** and the `self` keyword 🖇  
✅ Implement **the `__init__` constructor** 🚀  
✅ Understand **data abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding** 🎭  
✅ Work with **properties, getters, and setters** 🛠  
✅ Utilize **`__str__` and `__repr__` methods** for string representation 🖊  
✅ Distinguish between **object attributes and class attributes** 🎲  
✅ Use **class methods and static methods** 📌  
✅ Dynamically create and bind attributes to objects and classes 🔗  
✅ Explore **the `__dict__` attribute** and `getattr()` function 📜  

## ⚙️ Requirements  
### ✅ General  
- Editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
- Files are interpreted on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3` (version `3.8.5`)  
- Code must comply with **pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)**  
- All files must end with a **new line**  
- First line of all scripts: `#!/usr/bin/python3`  
- All files must be **executable**  
- **README.md** file is mandatory ✅  

## 📝 Task List  
### 📌 Mandatory  
1️⃣ **Simple rectangle** – Define a basic `Rectangle` class 📏  
2️⃣ **Real definition of a rectangle** – Add width and height attributes 📐  
3️⃣ **Area and Perimeter** – Implement methods to compute area and perimeter 📏  
4️⃣ **String representation** – Add `__str__` method for user-friendly representation ✍  
5️⃣ **Eval is magic** – Implement `__repr__` method for unambiguous representation 🧙  
6️⃣ **Detect instance deletion** – Use `__del__` to handle instance deletion 🚮  
7️⃣ **How many instances** – Track the number of instances of `Rectangle` 🧮  
8️⃣ **Change representation** – Modify the print symbol used for rectangle display ✨  
9️⃣ **Compare rectangles** – Compare rectangles based on their area 📊  
🔟 **A square is a rectangle** – Implement a method to check if a rectangle is a square 🔳

### 🌟 Advanced (Bonus)  
🚀 **Additional challenges to deepen your understanding!**
