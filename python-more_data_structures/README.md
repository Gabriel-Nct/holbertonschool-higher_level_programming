# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Overview
This repository delves into advanced Python programming techniques, particularly focusing on the powerful data structures: sets and dictionaries. The goal is to explore their unique characteristics, understand their optimal use cases, and integrate functional programming concepts to build efficient and clean solutions.

## Objectives
The project is designed to:
- Enhance problem-solving skills using sets and dictionaries.
- Introduce functional programming with tools such as `lambda`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
- Strengthen the understanding of Python's core features to handle complex scenarios efficiently.

## Key Features
- **Sets:** Learn their properties, methods, and when to use them compared to other collections.
- **Dictionaries:** Understand how to create, modify, and efficiently retrieve key-value pairs.
- **Functional Programming:** Apply functional concepts to streamline operations on data collections.
- **Iterative Development:** Build modular and reusable functions while adhering to Pythonic principles.

## Environment and Requirements
This repository adheres to specific standards to ensure compatibility and maintainability:
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Python Version:** Python 3.8.5
- **Editor Recommendations:** `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`
- **Coding Style:** Compliant with `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All scripts must be executable and include a proper shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/python3`).

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the project, contributors will:
- Master the unique traits and operations of sets and dictionaries.
- Differentiate the scenarios where sets or dictionaries provide the most efficient solution.
- Leverage functional programming to process and manipulate data effectively.
- Follow best practices for clean, efficient, and maintainable Python code.

## Usage
The project includes various scripts and examples demonstrating the use of sets and dictionaries. Clone the repository, execute the scripts, and explore the solutions provided. Feel free to modify and extend the examples to fit your learning or development needs.
