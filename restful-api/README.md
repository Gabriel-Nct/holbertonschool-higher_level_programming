## 📚 Understanding REST API

A RESTful API follows the **Representational State Transfer (REST)** architecture, ensuring a stateless, scalable, and cacheable communication system.

```
+-------+           +-------+           +---------+           +---------+
|       |  Request  |       |  Process  |         |  Fetch/   |         |
|       |   ----->  |       |  -------> |         |  Modify   |         |
|       |           |       |           |         |  -------> |         |
|       | <-----    |       | <-------  |         |           |         |
|       |  Response |       |  Return   |         |           |         |
+-------+           +-------+           +---------+           +---------+
  Client            Web Server           API Server           Database
```

### 🏗 Components:

-   🧑‍💻 **Client**: The requester of the service (web app, mobile app, etc.).
    
-   🌐 **Web Server**: Receives and forwards client requests.
    
-   🖥 **API Server**: Processes requests, fetches/modifies data.
    
-   🗄 **Database**: Stores and provides the required data.
    

### 🔄 Data Flow:

1.  The client sends an HTTP/HTTPS request.
    
2.  The Web Server forwards the request to the API Server.
    
3.  The API Server processes the request and interacts with the database.
    
4.  The API Server sends the response back through the Web Server.
    
5.  The client receives the final response.

## 🐍 Consuming and Processing Data with Python

#### Objective:

At the end of this exercise, students should be able to:

1.  Utilize the `requests` library to send HTTP requests and process responses.
2.  Parse and manipulate JSON data using Python.
3.  Convert structured data into other formats, e.g., CSV.

## 🌍 Developing a Simple API using Python's `http.server`

#### Objective:

At the end of this exercise, students should be able to:

1.  Set up a basic web server using the `http.server` module.
2.  Handle different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.).
3.  Serve JSON data in response to specific endpoints.
